When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when working remotely from another computer
- when contribute by another team member

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- it may conflict with my completed/uncompleted changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- use forks when want to clone another project on GitHub - usually from someone else's
- use clones for either on local or on GitHub
- use branch for the same project when necessary

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- so that we can compare what has been changed remotely after the last sync
